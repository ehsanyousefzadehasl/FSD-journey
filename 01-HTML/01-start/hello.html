    <title>Starting to become a FSD</title>

    <h1>Congratulations! First Web Page! I started again to code! :)</h1>
    <h2>I am going to learn what I need to know as soon as possible!</h2>
    <h3>I am reading, watching videos to become a professional developer.</h3>
    <h4>However, to be a professional, everybody knows just coding and coding and coding is the only solution.</h4>
    <p>Being a Full Stack Developer (FSD) is my goal to make a living (:D). So, I am going to learn and code what I need on this way.<br> <br> I try these days to improve my programming skills through solving programming problems.<br> Also, I focus on algorithms, probability and statistics. Additionally, I have to write tons of code to change into a real web developer. Beside, I believe a good web developer has a good sense of graphics and aesthetics :D.</p>
    <hr>
    <p> I write it here as <b>a memory</b>  for the time that I will be a professional FSD, and by reading it, <em>I will be proud of myself</em></p>
